## Answers

Machine Learning Questions

    Why do we split our dataset into training and testing sets, and how do you decide the right split ratio?
        To evaluate model performance on unseen data and ensure generalization.
        Common ratios: 80/20 or 70/30, but can vary depending on dataset size and variability.

    How does regularization prevent overfitting, and why do we use techniques like L1 and L2?
        Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models.
        L1 (Lasso): Promotes sparsity by shrinking some weights to zero.
        L2 (Ridge): Penalizes large weights without making them zero, ensuring smoother models.

    Why might a decision tree model overfit, and how can pruning help?
        Decision trees overfit due to excessive depth and capturing noise.
        Pruning removes less significant branches, reducing complexity and improving generalization.

    If you have a highly imbalanced dataset, why might accuracy not be the best metric? What would you use instead?
        Accuracy can be misleading as it ignores class distribution.
        Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, or AUC-ROC to better capture performance.

    Why does the curse of dimensionality affect distance-based algorithms like KNN, and how can you address it?
        High dimensions dilute distance metrics, making neighbors less distinguishable.
        Address it with dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) or feature selection.

Natural Language Processing Questions

    Why is tokenization an essential step in NLP, and what challenges arise when working with non-English languages?
        Tokenization breaks text into manageable units (words, phrases).
        Non-English challenges: Complex grammar, lack of spaces (e.g., Chinese), and agglutinative languages (e.g., Finnish).

    Why do we use embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT instead of one-hot encoding for text data?
        One-hot encoding is sparse and lacks semantic meaning.
        Embeddings capture contextual and semantic relationships in dense, lower-dimensional space.

    How would you handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in a model?
        Use embeddings trained on a larger corpus, subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding), or assign a default embedding.

    Why is stemming or lemmatization important, and when would you avoid using them?
        They reduce inflectional forms to root words, helping generalize text.
        Avoid if morphological details are important, e.g., distinguishing "better" from "good."

    If you’re building a sentiment analysis model, why might stopwords still hold importance in some cases?
        Stopwords like "not" or "never" can reverse sentiment and are thus contextually significant.

Statistics Questions

    Why is p-value important in hypothesis testing, and what does a p-value of 0.05 really mean?
        P-value quantifies the probability of observing results as extreme as current ones under the null hypothesis.
        A p-value of 0.05 means there’s a 5% chance the results are due to random variation.

    If two variables have a high correlation, why doesn’t it always imply causation?
        Correlation shows association but doesn’t account for confounding variables or causative direction.

    Why might the mean be misleading for a highly skewed dataset? What would you use instead?
        Mean is influenced by outliers.
        Use median or mode for a more robust central tendency.

    Why do we prefer confidence intervals over point estimates in statistical analysis?
        Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values, offering more information about estimation uncertainty.

    In linear regression, why is it important to check for multicollinearity?
        Multicollinearity inflates variance, making coefficient estimates unreliable.

Senior-Level/Tricky Questions

    Why might a gradient-boosting model outperform a deep learning model on small datasets?
        Gradient boosting can capture patterns efficiently without overfitting small datasets, while deep learning requires large data to learn effectively.

    If a dataset shows perfect multicollinearity between two features, why might one of them still be important?
        Even with redundancy, a specific feature might align better with domain knowledge or interpretability goals.

    When training a neural network for NLP, why might you freeze certain layers of the model?
        Freezing pretrained layers preserves learned knowledge while fine-tuning only task-specific layers, reducing computation and preventing overfitting.

    Why might sampling strategies like SMOTE sometimes fail in addressing class imbalance?
        SMOTE synthesizes new samples but may introduce noise, especially near class boundaries.

    Why does increasing the size of training data sometimes degrade performance on certain ML models?
        Larger datasets can increase noise, exacerbate overfitting, or overwhelm models without adequate regularization.
